Conservation International protects nature for the benefit of humanity. Through science, policy, fieldwork, and finance, we spotlight and secure the most important places in nature for the climate, biodiversity, and for people. With offices in 30 countries and projects in more than 100 countries, Conservation International partners with governments, companies, civil society, Indigenous peoples, and local communities to help people and nature thrive together.

**POSITION SUMMARY \\- This position is based in Singapore**


CI is a global leader in Natural Climate Solutions (NCS). As demand grows for high\\-quality conservation projects that can access voluntary and compliance carbon markets, CI is expanding its carbon project portfolio and its technical assistance to carbon policy initiatives.  

The NFG Global Carbon Team provides technical and financial support for NCS project origination, scoping, and development. As part of this team, the Asia Pacific Carbon Team supports CI field programs and partners across the region with carbon project development, implementation, and enabling\\-conditions work. The team also manages the Technical Assistance Facility (TAF), a multi\\-donor mechanism that provides early\\-stage technical support and targeted investments to advance NCS project development and strengthen the foundational conditions required for high\\-quality carbon projects.


The Asia Pacific Carbon Team is seeking a Natural Climate Solutions Analyst to work with the Director of Climate Projects on the scoping, feasibility, development, and implementation of carbon projects across the Asia\\-Pacific region. The role provides technical and project management support across the carbon project cycle, including delivery of project rapid assessments, feasibility studies, Project Design Documents, and Monitoring Reports, and supports policy\\-related analysis where relevant to NCS and jurisdictional REDD\\+ nesting.


The Analyst oversees small to moderate projects and components of larger ones, leading planning, implementation, tracking, and reporting.

* Work with the Director of Climate Projects, Senior Director of Asia Pacific NCS, regional Deal Leads, and technical partners to support the development of workplans and budgets for carbon project development activities.
* Support coordination with project stakeholders to ensure activities comply with voluntary/compliance standards and CI’s climate, biodiversity, social, financial, and governance safeguards.
* Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with governments, NGOs, scientists, partners, and local communities to support NCS\\-related knowledge sharing and capacity building.
* Gather, organize, and share project information, action plans, and deliverables with internal and external stakeholders. Support project bids and proposal development as assigned.
* Ensure partner and donor requirements are reflected in project deliverables and support review of outputs for alignment with agreements.
* Serve as a project information resource, supporting effective communication and information flow among partners and stakeholders.
* Support the implementation of carbon project activities by assisting with planning, logistics, tracking of progress, documentation, and follow\\-up actions.
* Support monitoring of project progress and provide technical input to improve project management and implementation.
* Help identify capacity\\-building needs and support actions that address technical or operational gaps. Contribute to identifying tools, resources, and training required for project success.
* Support preparation of reporting summaries and project narratives and coordinate with headquarters and program finance and operations staff on project financial reporting.

  

Additional responsibilities

* Support the Center for Policy and Incentives with research and analysis that inform the design of policy frameworks relevant to NCS, including REDD\\+ nesting frameworks and enabling conditions.
* Coordinate with other groups within NFG—including CI Ventures, Long\\-term Finance, and Advisory Services—to identify funding opportunities, support the development of finance mechanisms, and contribute to financial modeling and analysis to assess project economics.
* Prepare confidential investment\\-related materials for third\\-party investors under advisory services agreements or as part of co\\-investment opportunities in high\\-quality projects.
* Support select NCS initiatives related to biodiversity credits and freshwater outcomes, ensuring alignment with CI’s broader conservation finance objectives.
