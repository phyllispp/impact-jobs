* Introduce a centralized contract management system or repository to ensure version control and easy access to executed agreements

**Commercial agreement optimisation**

* Conduct a comprehensive audit of all existing commercial templates (Partnership Agreements, Customer Agreements, NDAs)
* Redraft and improve core templates to ensure they are market-leading, protect the company’s IP, and minimize negotiation friction

**HR partnership**

* Serve as the lead legal advisor to the HR department on sensitive employment matters, including performance management, terminations, and workplace grievances

**Humility:** There is so much we don’t know. Humility allows for open-mindedness to feedback and a willingness to learn from others. It paves the way for collaboration and creates a positive work environment. It is a key ingredient of self awareness and emotional intelligence.

**Structured Thinking:** Our business is complex with many layers (many services, many countries, many cultures). Regardless of whether you’re more analytical or creative in nature, being able to show sound judgement is important to us. It ensures solutions are pragmatic and balance the needs of the organisation, team and customers.

**Can have tough conversations in a positive way:** It’s not a matter of if, but when difficult interpersonal situations arise.
