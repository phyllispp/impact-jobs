* Champion data‑informed iteration in domains such as **report sharing, remediation tracking, and supplier engagement**.

+ Familiarity with accessibility standards (WCAG), responsive design, and performance‑aware UI patterns.

* **Research:** Skilled in qualitative and quantitative methods (interviews, task studies, surveys, usability testing), with the ability to convert insights into product decisions.
* **Communication:** Clear writing and storytelling tailored to internal and external audiences; ability to **articulate trade‑offs** and influence cross‑functional teams.
* **Mindset:** Self‑directed, commercially aware, systematic, and comfortable operating as a **team of one** in a fast‑evolving product area.

* Establish a baseline **design system** (tokens + components) adopted by engineering with release QA gates.

-------------------------------------------------

Backed by three of the world’s largest banks, FourTwoThree is quietly building resilience for an uncertain future.

We connect lenders, large corporates, suppliers and the bedrock of the global economy — small and medium-sized businesses — through a data-driven platform, strengthened by modern AI, that turns complex financial, operational and climate data into commercially actionable insight at both individual business and portfolio level.

Our work sits at the intersection of financial institutions, enterprise customers, climate and resilience, unlocking new, data-qualified products, services and financing pathways across Asia-Pacific and beyond.

**The Company**
---------------

FourTwoThree is a financial and climate technology company building a platform designed for bank-grade, enterprise-scale use.

We partner closely with financial institutions and large corporates to:

* Improve visibility of risk, resilience and transition exposure across portfolios and supply chains
* Engage SMEs through incentives and commercially aligned, personalised actions
* Enable new classes of institutional products and services grounded in high-quality operational data

Our platform operates in highly complex environments — integrating with bank systems, enterprise workflows and external data providers, while navigating evolving regulatory, reporting and climate standards. In this context we use AI to accelerate ingestion and classification, while keeping outputs explainable and audit-ready for institutional use.

We are already working with leading institutions and co-creation partners, and are led by founders with deep experience across banking, enterprise technology and sustainability, operating across global markets.

**The Role**
------------

We’re looking for a Senior Product Manager with strong commercial instincts and deep product craft, who is comfortable operating with large institutional customers and still wants to stay close to the work.

This role is ideal for someone who:

* Has deep hands-on product experience but also spent a good part of their career in commercial/ client facing responsibilities
* Able to easily build relationships with banks, large corporates and senior stakeholders
* Can manage complex integrations and delivery programmes
* Still wants to be on the tools shaping the product, writing stories, working daily with engineers and designers

You will own significant product domains and integration pathways, working directly with institutional customers to translate commercial objectives, operational realities and regulatory constraints into scalable product solutions including helping to shape how we apply AI to reduce manual mapping, improve data quality, and unlock more accurate insights and action pathways for customers.

**What You’ll Be Doing**
------------------------

* Own and drive complex product initiatives from discovery through to delivery and post-launch iteration
* Act as the primary product interface for large institutional customers during integration and rollout
* Translate commercial agreements, customer requirements and regulatory considerations into clear product direction
* Work hands-on with engineering and design to define epics, stories, acceptance criteria and delivery plans
* Lead product thinking across bank integrations, data flows, APIs, AI and broader platform capabilities
* Navigate trade-offs between customer-specific needs and scalable platform design
* Support scalable onboarding of new frameworks, actions and attributes by designing systems where AI accelerates structuring, while product rules ensure consistency and auditability.
* Partner closely with sales and institutional delivery teams to ensure successful customer outcomes
* Use data, feedback and commercial signals to guide prioritisation and roadmap decisions
* Contribute to product strategy, particularly where customer demand, commercial opportunity and platform capability intersect

**What We’re Looking For**
--------------------------

* 6-10+ years of experience across commercial, customer-facing or delivery roles, with significant time in product management
* Proven experience working with banks, financial institutions or large enterprise customers
* Strong product fundamentals in discovery, problem framing, prioritisation, execution and iteration
* Deep comfort with integration-heavy products (APIs, data pipelines, system constraints, security considerations)
* Ability to reason from first principles, especially in ambiguous, multi-stakeholder environments
* Commercially astute - you understand how product decisions affect revenue, risk and customer relationships
* Confident operating with senior stakeholders while remaining deeply engaged in delivery detail
* Pragmatic, outcome-focused and able to balance speed with institutional-grade quality
* Comfortable working across regions, cultures and time zones

**Bonus Points If You Have**
----------------------------

* Experience in fintech, climate tech, enterprise SaaS or regulated platforms
* Background in banking, consulting, customer delivery or enterprise implementations
* Exposure to climate, ESG, risk, compliance or reporting frameworks
* Experience launching products across APAC or global markets
* Familiarity with complex B2B commercial and partnership models

**Why Join Us**
---------------

* Competitive compensation and meaningful equity
* A senior role with real ownership and a variety of work while playing a significant part in scaling the company overtime
* Direct exposure to major global financial institutions and enterprise customers
* The credibility and backing of large banks, with the autonomy and pace of a focused, high-calibre team
* The opportunity to build products that sit at the centre of finance, climate transition, resilience and real economic impact

The NFG Global Carbon Team provides technical and financial support for NCS project origination, scoping, and development. As part of this team, the Asia Pacific Carbon Team supports CI field programs and partners across the region with carbon project development, implementation, and enabling-conditions work. The team also manages the Technical Assistance Facility (TAF), a multi-donor mechanism that provides early-stage technical support and targeted investments to advance NCS project development and strengthen the foundational conditions required for high-quality carbon projects.

The Asia Pacific Carbon Team is seeking a Natural Climate Solutions Analyst to work with the Director of Climate Projects on the scoping, feasibility, development, and implementation of carbon projects across the Asia-Pacific region. The role provides technical and project management support across the carbon project cycle, including delivery of project rapid assessments, feasibility studies, Project Design Documents, and Monitoring Reports, and supports policy-related analysis where relevant to NCS and jurisdictional REDD+ nesting.

The Analyst oversees small to moderate projects and components of larger ones, leading planning, implementation, tracking, and reporting.

This role involves regional travel and requires the ability to work effectively across diverse cultures, languages, and socioeconomic contexts.
